    <h1>On being a consumer and trying to stop it</h1>
    I think many people these days are finding themselves just consooming netfix shows, social media and other instant gratification shit.
    That's bad for obvious reasons.
    I wanna try and stop using any social media, netflix... for 30 days, and look how I would spend my time as a zoomer-consoomer))),
    who basically grew up with the internet.
    I will document every day in these 30 days on this blog.
    Also if will try to minimize my use of messengers to a given time of the day.
    My main goal is to fight my addiction and improve my concentration skills, regarding to deep work.
